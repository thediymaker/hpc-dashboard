# HPC Dashboard

This repository contains the source code for the HPC Dashboard, a Next.js application designed to monitor the status of SLURM nodes. The dashboard provides total utilization metrics for CPU and GPU nodes, as well as detailed individual node status. This is a small portion of a much larger, full HPC management project i am working on that includes things like managing LDAP users, slurm associations, tracking services sold, and renewals.

## Features

- View total utilization of CPU and GPU nodes.
- Individual node status with details on CPU, GPU, and memory usage.
- Styled with Shadcn and Tailwind CSS.
- Built with Next.js and Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Yarn or npm
- Slurm API enabled on your HPC cluster
- Slurm API token for authentication

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thediymaker/slurm-node-dashboard.git
cd slurm-node-dashboard
```

### Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t slurm-node-dashboard .
```

### Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 slurm-node-dashboard
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file.

```plaintext
COMPANY_NAME=""

```

**You will also need to make sure you place your logo.png in the plublic directory, as well as replace the default favicon.ico with your own.**


## Docker Configuration

Here's a brief overview of the Docker setup:

- **Base Image:** Uses `node:18-alpine` for a lightweight container.
- **Dependencies:** Installs project dependencies selectively based on the presence of a lock file.
- **Building:** Compiles the Next.js project.
- **Running:** Uses a non-root user for improved security.

Refer to the `Dockerfile` in the repository for detailed configuration.
